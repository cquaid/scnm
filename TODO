Daemonize.  Spawn new thread when new attach is requested.
Main thread contains list of message queue ids for each process.
frontend sends commands to the message queue for the requested pid.


Command line accessable (for scripting).
Still needs a shell frontend for searching.


Multithread the frontend so set loops can be implemented properly.


Add filtering for the regions list.

Need commands to stop game and to continue game so shell scripts can:
stop. get address value. process. set. continue. without underlying data changing.
